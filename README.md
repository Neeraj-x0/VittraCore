**Status:** Public • Read-Only • All Rights Reserved

VittraCore MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a secure, context-aware communication standard that enables AI agents to execute real-world operations—such as payments, bookings, and service orchestration—by interfacing with multiple systems using structured context and user-granted consent.

## What is VittraCore?

VittraCore acts as the backbone for Agentic UPI Wallet systems, offering a scalable protocol layer that empowers intelligent agents to interact with digital services in a secure and modular way. It abstracts away low-level APIs and exposes a unified interface that prioritizes context, intent, and action integrity.

## Key Capabilities

- Contextual message routing across multiple agents
- Consent-enforced execution of critical actions (e.g. UPI transactions)
- Stateless multi-service orchestration with isolation
- Plugin-ready architecture for third-party service integrations
- Production-grade resilience and observability

## Why VittraCore?

Most systems treat AI as just inference. VittraCore treats it as **agency**—with safety, structure, and precision. This is how agentic computing meets regulated systems like UPI.
